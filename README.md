Hard Disk Drive (HDD) scheduling is a vital component of modern operating systems, 
significantly influencing the efficiency and performance of data storage systems. This report 
delves into the fundamental principles and various algorithms utilized in HDD scheduling, 
which govern the order in which read and write requests are serviced by the disk. Efficient 
scheduling is crucial for optimizing system performance, ensuring fair access to the disk, and 
maximizing throughput and response times in data-intensive environments. 
The report provides a comprehensive analysis of several key HDD scheduling 
algorithms, including First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), 
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm), C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK scheduling. Each algorithm is 
evaluated based on essential performance metrics such as seek time, rotational latency, 
throughput, and average response time. By comparing these metrics, the report elucidates the 
strengths and weaknesses of each scheduling method, offering insights into their suitability for 
different types of workloads and disk access patterns.
